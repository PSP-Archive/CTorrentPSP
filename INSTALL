How to install:

$ ./configure
$ make install
$ hash
$ ctorrent -h

If SSL support is not found, the public-domain SHA1 code will be used.
To force the use of this code, specify:
  --with-ssl=no
as a parameter to the configure script.
To give configure a hint about where to find SSL on your system, specify:
  --with-ssl=DIR
where DIR is the common directory under which sha.h and the SSL libraries
are located.  For example, if the files are located at:
  /opt/include/openssl/sha.h
  /opt/lib/libcrypto.a
use:
  --with-ssl=/opt
There are several combinations of subdirectories that will be tried by
the configure script.  If all else fails, create symbolic links for
sha.h and the applicable library (libssl.a, libcrypto.a, libcrypt.a, or
libmd.a) in a single directory and specify that.

Or set the CPPFLAGS environment variable to "-Idir" (where "dir" is the
directory in which sha.h resides) and the LDFLAGS environment variable
to "-Ldir" (where "dir" is the directory in which the library containing
SHA1 support resides), then re-run configure.

Check the documentation or man page for your shell to determine how to
set an environment variable.
Example using csh/tcsh:
  setenv CPPFLAGS "-I/usr/local/include"

Hint:  You can use the "strings" command to help determine whether SHA1
support is present in a library, as in:
  strings libcrypto.a | grep SHA1_Init
